# vatannarda

Engineering-focused developer working at the intersection of  
**software systems, automation, and applied mathematics**.

I focus on building **robust, maintainable, and security-aware systems**,  
rather than short-lived demos or trend-driven code.

## 🔐 Security & Reliability

- Secure configuration practices
- Secrets management
- Defensive development mindset
- Threat awareness and risk mitigation
- Audit-oriented system design

(Security is treated as an engineering discipline, not a buzzword.)

---

## 📊 Applied Mathematics & Modeling

- Mathematical modeling
- Differential equations
- Statistical fitting & analysis
- Simulation-driven reasoning

This background strongly influences how I design systems and make technical decisions.

---

## 🎯 Philosophy

- Prefer **clarity over cleverness**
- Favor **long-term maintainability**
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Treat infrastructure and security as first-class concerns
- Build systems meant to survive real-world usage

---

## 📌 Notes

- This profile is **engineering-oriented**, not tutorial-focused  
- Code shared publicly is intentionally scoped and sanitized  
- Older experimental material has been removed for safety and clarity
